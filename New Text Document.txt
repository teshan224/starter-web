In todayâ€™s digital age, cybersecurity has become a cornerstone of organizational resilience. With increasing reliance on interconnected systems and cloud-based services, businesses are more exposed to cyber threats than ever before. Cyberattacks such as ransomware, phishing, and zero-day exploits can disrupt operations, compromise sensitive data, and erode customer trust. Implementing robust security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and employee training programs, is essential for defending against such threats. By proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, organizations can minimize the risk of financial and reputational damage caused by cyber incidents.
